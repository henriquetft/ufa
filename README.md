# UFA (User File Attributes)

![example workflow](https://github.com/henriquetft/ufa/actions/workflows/cmake-single-platform.yml/badge.svg)

UFA - User File Attributes is a system that allows the user to set and manage custom tags and "key-values" attributes for files.

These tags and attributes could be used as additional metadata of the file, allowing several kinds of operations on files, such as search by tag/attribute and even mount a tag-based filesystem (fuse), presenting files based on tags, not on filesystem folders.
